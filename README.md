# UI/UX  Challenge

Analyze the user interface and design of one small piece of a real-world website.

## Marching Orders

Choose a website you are familiar with, and find one functionality of that website that you want to analyze. You will not be able to cover a user story and use case/interaction flow that encompasses the entire website. Instead, pick one small piece of it. Examples of good choices for this project:

* Commenting on a post on a news site
* Searching for a product on an ecommerce site
* Favoriting a post on a social media site

### Technical Instructions
* Create a deployment on ddc-web-student and make sure it is 100% correct and functional.

* Define one (1) Persona for your chosen site in an html document called `/persona.html`. 
  *  Be sure to put the name of your site and a link to it on this page as well.
  
* Define one (1) User Story for your Persona in an html document called `/user-story.html`.
  * The user story should be short enough to fit on a sticky note, and discribe what the persona/end-user is trying to accomplish.
  
* Document one (1) Use Case/Interaction Flow based on your Persona in an html document called `/interaction-flow.html `. 
  * List the specific steps the user must take to arrive at their goal. Make sure to include the system responses for each user-initiated action TLDR this should be a back and forth dialog between the browser and the user. 
  * Use an HTML unordered list.
