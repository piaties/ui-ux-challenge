<h1>User Story</h1><br>
<br>
<p>
    User Story: "If I don't have the answer I will find it" is his mantra.  Time for work and entertainment
    is sparse thanks to LLL smartphone the news, which is his main form of entertainment, is almost always accessible.

    Personality: This lifelong learner (LLL) prides himself on his accumulation of knowledge.
    He often enjoys seeking social environment where academic conversations and company can be
    found.  Quick to be-friend and tough to upset this LLL often finds himself in the area of
    advice giving and general listening.  To support this active position this LLL also highly values
    current events and the stories that have lead to the events.  Seeking a lesson from every situation.
    This LLL also values his time and will often mix work with pleasure.  One of his daily practices is to
    listen to streaming news radio or a podcast while doing daily maintenance chores and commuting.

    Goals: This LLL has always associated "being in the know" with opportunity.  It is very important to him
    to attain an active life applying his constently expanding collection of knowledge.  A romantic partner who
    shares in his 'likes' would be nice too.

    Pain Points: "With much wisdom comes much sorrow" this LLL may occasionally find it difficult to not let
    the many sad events in the world get him down.  Because of this he often limits his consumption of current events
    to one hour or so.  But a busy schedule often causes him to miss out on preferred news radio shows. This is why he
    chooses to follow the largest NPR radio station, wnyc.org.  New York's public news radio station.
